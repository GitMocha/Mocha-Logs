# Mocha-Logs
QB-Core Edits Implementing Logs.

These logs were made to help servers monitor
there players/staff activities on the server.

This includes basic commands like "911" to robbery rewards
and admin powers. 

!!!! YOU MUST COPY EACH LOG LINE FOR LINE NOT JUST THE 'CREATELOG' PART. 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES. IF YOU DM SAYING YOUR LOGS BROKEN AND I CAN SEE 
YOU HAVENT FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AND COPIED THE WHOLE THING
I WILL NOT OFFER SUPPORT !!!!

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute feel
free to make a PR or Dm me on discord @Mocha#3333.

I've now created a discord (link to follow). This will be for future scripts (paid and free)
member support and suggestions/feedback. 

Thanks!
